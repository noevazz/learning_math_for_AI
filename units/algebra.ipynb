    "## What Is Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "Algebra is a branch of mathematics where letters and symbols represent numbers and quantities in equations and expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "![algebra.jpg](../media/img/algebra.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equations and Inequalities\n",
    "\n",
    "An **equation** in algebra is a mathematical statement that shows that two expressions are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2w+5=11,\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example `w` represents an unknown value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the equation implies finding the value of `w` so the equation remains true. For the example above the answer is `w=3`. You can confirm this result by substituting the result in the equation and check if the equality remains true:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2(3)+5=11\n",
    "   6+5=11\n",
    "    11=11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We have confirmed `3` is the right number that keeps the balance (equality).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how do you find the value of `w`?, that's what we are going to study in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving An Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "In orders to solve an equation you have to isolate the variable on one side of the equal sign so you can have the actual value on the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can play with the equation and add, subtract, divide, multiply, etc. values to the equation to isolate the variable, but you need to keep the balance at any point, that means if you want to subtract `-5` of one side, then you MUST do it in both side to keep the balance (equality):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2w+5 = 11\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's subtract -5:\n",
    "2w+5-5 = 11-5\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplify:\n",
    "2w = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's remove that 2 by dividing by 2:\n",
    "2w/2 = 6/2\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplify:\n",
    "w = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "THE ANSWER IS 3 OH YEAH!!!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can replace `3` in the original equation `2w+5 = 11` and see if the result is `11`, if true then `3` is in fact the right answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes adding an operation in both sides can be pretty obvious, some people like to save some lines by just writing the next expression that keeps the equation in balance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2w+5 = 11\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's subtract -5:\n",
    "2w = 11-5      You can see I directly removed +5\n",
    "Some people go further and directly reduce 11-5:\n",
    "\n",
    "2w = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally divide by 2:\n",
    "w = 3           This time I simplified 6/2 directly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this as long as you keep your process readable, sometimes making things clears is better than writing less.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To remember: that `2` attached to `2w` is called **coefficient** and it represents a multiplication, this time `2 times w`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the variable is `k`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                -k/6+4 = 28\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by the easy tasks:\n",
    "remove that +4:   -k/6 = 24   I subtracted -4\n",
    "remove that 1/6:    -k = 144  I multiplied by 6 in both sides\n",
    "\n",
    "Now finally multiply by -1 so k will be positive:\n",
    "                     k = -144\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: in this example the coefficient attached to `k` was a fractional coefficient, `1/6` to be precised. `(1/6)*k` is the same as `k/6`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check if our result is right:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                -k/6+4 = 28\n",
    "           -(-144)/6+4 = 28\n",
    "               144/6+4 = 28\n",
    "                  24+4 = 28\n",
    "                    28 = 28\n",
    "\n",
    "                  OH YEAH!!!!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                x + 3 = 5 + 3\n",
    "        In this case we can directly cancel +3:\n",
    "                    x = 5\n",
    "        Why? because it is the same as:\n",
    "                x+3-3 = 5+3-3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you find the same `terms` in both sides then you can directly cancel them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "–3x – 21 = –2x + 7\n",
    "     -3x = -2x + 7 + 21\n",
    "     -3x = -2x + 28\n",
    "-3x + 2x = 28\n",
    "      -x = 28\n",
    "      x = -28\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    –3x – 21 = –2x + 7\n",
    "-3(-28) - 21 = -2(-28) + 7\n",
    "     84 - 21 = 56 + 7\n",
    "          63 = 63\n",

    "A matrix is a collection of `elements` arranged in `rows` and `columns`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `order` of a matrix describes how many rows and columns a matrix have, e.g. a matrix of order 3x5 (three by five) has 3 rows and 5 columns.\n",

    "Matrix are typically displayed surrounded by big brackets:\n",

    "- The matrix ***A***, you can use any letter to named a matrix.\n",
    "- In algebra the letter used to represent a matrix **is typically in bold, uppercase and italic** so it can be distinguished from other types of variables.\n",
    "- The position of each element is identified with a subscript where the first number is the row, and the second is the column.\n",
    "- Typically, the same letter used to represent the entire matrix is used to represent a specific element but in lowercase.\n",
    "- Instead of `x` and `y`, as in the cartesian plane, we use `i` and `j` when talking about matrices.\n",

    "Matrices are typically composed of elements that belong to a common field, such as real numbers, complex numbers, or integers. Mixing different types of numbers within a single matrix isn't inherently invalid, but it may not always make sense depending on the context of the problem you're working on.\n",
