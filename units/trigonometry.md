Radians are a unit of measurement used in mathematics to measure angles.

People are used to degrees, another unit of measure, which divide a circle into 360 equal parts:

> A protractor is shown in the image above, it is a geometric tool used to measure angles. It typically consists of a semi-circular or full-circle transparent plastic or metal device with markings from 0 to 180 degrees or 0 to 360 degrees. In spanish it is called "transportador".

Radians measure angles **based on the radius** of a circle.

### What is a radian

In simple terms, if you were to wrap the circumference of a circle around its radius, it would equal 2π radians. This means that there are 2π radians in a full circle, which is equivalent to 360°:

180° is equal to 3.14159265358.... radians, in other words 1πRAD.

360° is equal to 2(3.14159265358....) radians, in other words 2πRAD.
