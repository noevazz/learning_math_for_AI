from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs, Eq

# Define the variable
x = symbols('x')

# Define two separate equations for when the expression inside the absolute value is positive and negative
equation1 = Eq(20 * (3*x - 3), 20)
equation2 = Eq(20 * (3*x - 3), -20)

# Solve the equations
solutions1 = solve(equation1, x)
solutions2 = solve(equation2, x)

# Combine the solutions
all_solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

print("Solutions:", all_solutions)

# Output:
# Solutions: [4/3, 2/3]
